          <h1 class="sr-only">Charles Barkley Biography</h1>
        </header>
        <p>
          <strong>Charles Wade Barkley</strong> (born February 20, 1963) is an
          American former professional basketball player who is a television
          analyst on TNT and CBS Sports. Nicknamed "Sir Charles", "the Bread
          Truck", and "the Round Mound of Rebound", Barkley played 16 seasons in
          the National Basketball Association (NBA). Though shorter than the
          typical power forward, he used his strength and aggression to become
          one of the NBA's best rebounders and scorers. Barkley was an 11-time
          NBA All-Star, 11-time member of the All-NBA Team, and the 1993 NBA
          Most Valuable Player (MVP). He was named to the NBA's 50th and 75th
          anniversary teams.
        </p>

        <p>
          An All-American at Auburn University, Barkley was drafted as a junior
          by the Philadelphia 76ers with the fifth pick of the 1984 NBA draft.
          In his rookie season, Barkley was named to the All-Rookie First Team
          in 1985. In the 1986–87 season, Barkley led the league in rebounding
          average and earned his first rebounding title. He was named the
          All-Star Game MVP in 1991, and in 1993 with the Phoenix Suns, he was
          voted the league's MVP while leading the team to the NBA Finals. He
          also competed in the 1992 and 1996 Olympic Games, winning two gold
          medals as a member of the U.S. national team. In 2000, Barkley retired
          as the fourth player in NBA history to achieve 20,000 points, 10,000
          rebounds, and 4,000 assists.
        </p>

        <p>
          Barkley is a two-time inductee into the Naismith Memorial Basketball
          Hall of Fame, inducted in 2006 for his individual career and in 2010
          as a member of the 1992 Olympic "Dream Team".
        </p>

        <section id="early-life">
          <h2>Early life</h2>
          <p>
            Barkley was born in Leeds, Alabama, 17 miles (27 km) east of
            Birmingham and grew up there. He was the first black baby born at a
            segregated, all-white town hospital and was in the first group of
            black students at his elementary school.
          </p>
          <p>
            His parents divorced when he was young after his father abandoned
            the family, which included younger brother Darryl Barkley. His
            mother remarried and they had a son, John Glenn. Another brother,
            Rennie, died in infancy. His stepfather was killed in an accident
            when Charles was 11 years old.
          </p>
          <p>
            Barkley attended Leeds High School. As a junior, he stood 5 ft 10 in
            (1.78 m) and weighed 220 pounds (100 kg). He failed to make the
            varsity team and was named as a reserve. However, during the summer
            Barkley grew to 6 ft 4 in (1.93 m) and earned a starting position on
            the varsity as a senior. He averaged 19.1 points and 17.9 rebounds
            per game and led his team to a 26–3 record en route to the state
            semi-finals.
          </p>
          <p>
            Despite his improvement, Barkley received no attention from college
            scouts until the state high school semi-finals, where he scored 26
            points against Alabama's most highly recruited player, Bobby Lee
            Hurt. An assistant to Auburn University's head coach, Sonny Smith,
            was at the game and reported seeing, "a fat guy... who can play like
            the wind". Barkley was soon recruited by Smith and majored in
            business management while attending Auburn University.

          <p>
            Barkley played collegiate basketball for the Auburn Tigers for three
            seasons. Although he struggled to control his weight, he excelled as
            a player and led the SEC in rebounding each year.
          </p>
          <p>
            He became a popular crowd-pleaser, exciting the fans with dunks and
            blocked shots that belied his lack of height and overweight frame.
            It was not uncommon to see the hefty Barkley grab a defensive
            rebound and, instead of passing, dribble the entire length of the
            court and finish at the opposite end with a two-handed dunk. His
            physical size and skills ultimately earned him the nickname "The
            Round Mound of Rebound" and the "Crisco Kid".
          </p>
          <p>
            During his college career, Barkley played center, despite being
            shorter than the average center. His height, officially listed as 6
            ft 6 in (1.98 m), is stated as 6 ft 4 in (1.93 m) in his book,
            <em>I May Be Wrong but I Doubt It</em>. He became a member of
            Auburn's All-Century team and still holds the Auburn record for
            career field goal percentage with 62.6%.
          </p>
          <p>
            He received numerous awards, including Southeastern Conference (SEC)
            Player of the Year (1984), three All-SEC selections and one Second
            Team All-American selection.
          </p>
          <p>
            In Barkley's three-year college career, he averaged 14.1 points on
            62.6% field goal shooting, 9.6 rebounds, 1.6 assists, and 1.7 blocks
            per game. In 1984, he led the Tigers to their first NCAA tournament
            in school history and finished with 23 points on 80% field goal
            shooting, 17 rebounds, four assists, two steals, and two blocks.
            Auburn retired Barkley's No. 34 jersey on March 3, 2001.

            <p>
              Barkley left before his final year at Auburn and made himself
              eligible for the 1984 NBA draft. He was selected with the fifth
              pick in the first round by the Philadelphia 76ers, two slots after
              the Chicago Bulls drafted Michael Jordan. He joined a veteran team
              that included Julius Erving, Moses Malone, and Maurice Cheeks,
              players who had taken Philadelphia to the 1983 NBA championship.
              Under the tutelage of Malone, Barkley was able to manage his
              weight and learned to prepare and condition himself properly for a
              game; Barkley cited Malone as the most influential player of his
              career, and he often referred to him as "Dad".
            </p>
            <p>
              He averaged 14.0 points and 8.6 rebounds per game during the
              regular season and earned a berth on the All-Rookie Team. In the
              postseason, the Sixers advanced to the Eastern Conference Finals
              but were defeated in five games by the Boston Celtics.
            </p>
            <p>
              During his second year, Barkley improved his game under the
              leadership of Moses Malone during the off-season with his
              workouts, in the process he became the team's leading rebounder
              and number two scorer, averaging 20.0 points and 12.8 rebounds per
              game.
            </p>
            <p>
              He became the Sixers' starting power forward and helped lead his
              team into the playoffs, averaging 25.0 points on .578 shooting
              from the field and 15.8 rebounds per game. Despite his efforts,
              Philadelphia was defeated 4–3 by the Milwaukee Bucks in the
              Eastern Conference Semifinals. He was named to the All-NBA Second
              Team.
